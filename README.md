# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Visualization-Using-Python
Practiced end-to-end data analysis using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to clean, explore, and visualize COVID-19 datasets, uncovering trends, correlations, and actionable insights.

## Project Background 
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical need for accurate and timely data analysis to support global health decisions. It generated vast, complex datasets that often contained missing values, inconsistent formats, and redundant information, making proper cleaning and analysis essential for meaningful insights.

This project uses Python and its libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to perform an end-to-end process of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Visualization techniques are applied to uncover trends, correlations, and key factors related to the pandemic, while strengthening practical data analytics skills.

## Project Objective
The key objectives of this project are as follows:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing – Use Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to clean and prepare COVID-19 datasets for analysis.
- Data Quality Management – Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and perform feature engineering to ensure data integration and consistency.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Explore and visualize data distributions, trends, and correlations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Regional and Temporal Analysis – Identify patterns in COVID-19 case distribution across regions and over time.
- Dynamic and Interactive Exploration – Allow user selection of specific countries for deeper insights.
- Insight Generation – Examine the influence of external factors (e.g., vaccination rates, smoking prevalence) on fatality rates, while strengthening Python-based analytical proficiency.

## ⚙️ Technical Tools and Libraries Used
This project utilizes several key Python libraries and tools to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Each plays a specific role in ensuring efficient data processing and insightful exploration.
- 🔢 NumPy
- 🐼 Pandas
- 📈 Matplotlib
- 🎨 Seaborn
- 💻 Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook – Provides an interactive environment

## 🌍 Dataset Description: Our World in Data (OWID)
The dataset used originates from Our World in Data (OWID), a reliable open-source platform that compiles official COVID-19 statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) and national health authorities. Covering January 2020 – December 2023, it includes daily updates on key indicators:
- 🦠 Case Data – Total and new confirmed cases
- ⚰️ Death Data – Total and new reported deaths
- 💉 Vaccination Data – Doses administered, people vaccinated, and booster shots
- 🧪 Testing Data – Testing volume and positivity rates
- 🏥 Hospital Data – Hospital and ICU patient counts
- 📊 Demographic & Policy Data – Population, GDP, HDI, and government stringency indexes

This dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for global COVID-19 trend analysis.
